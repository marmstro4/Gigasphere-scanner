########################Introduction###########################
This is the control software for the gigasphere scanner setup.

The scanner setup is intended to test ultra-high rate germanium
strip detectors with a collomated source.

The setup conists of a large tungsten collimator suspended by
ropes and counterweights controlled by two 150mm range zaber
motors.

These motors control the x,y position of the collimator
hole through which radioactive decays can reach the surface
of the ultra high rate detector being tested through the an
enclosing cryostat that keeps the detector and its electronics
cool.

########################Installation###########################
This code depends upon the Zaber motion library avilable here:
https://software.zaber.com/motion-library/docs/tutorials/install/py

It also depends upon matplotlib and other generic python modules.
These can be typically be installed with pip install [missing dependency]

###########################Operation###########################
The scan confiruation is controlled by parameters defined in the
main function.

The length_x and length_y parameters control the [millimeter]
region to be scanned.

The step size parameter controls the [millimeter] steps in which
the scan takes place.

The period parameter controls how long the scanner will sit and
aquire data at a particular location.

As indicated in the terminal you can pause/resume/quit the scan
with the p,r and q keys in the terminal

############################Output#############################
As the scan progresses creates files named after the position,
time, date of the scan. The format is

x_y_time_day_month_year
